<p>After Istanbul International Dance Festival…</p>
<p>This year’s Istanbul International Dance Festival, which is Turkey’s biggest and is among the most important dance festivals in the world, was amazing. It took place at the Hilton Bosphorus Hotel between 29 March and 3 April and was full of dancing and fun.</p>
<p>It was a great advantage for the participants and the attendees that the hotel was in the city center. Due to our country’s current situation, there were not many foreign participants, but the halls were full of people.</p>
<p>World-famous foreign and Turkish trainers and dancers simultaneously gathered in 9 different halls and taught the delicacies of dancing from 11.00 a.m. until 8.00 p.m. They also did shows at nights. While there were shows taking place, parties started at around 11.00 p.m., moved to the big hall at 01.30 a.m. and continued until 07.00 a.m.</p>
<p>Although we danced day and night, we still kept saying “I wish everyday was a festival!”</p>
<p>Some of our HEP Dans students purchased full pass tickets to attend both daytime workshops and nighttime shows and parties, while the others only joined us during nighttime events. Everyone left the festival with a huge smile on their faces. Because dancing is a different kind of energy. And being together in a place where this energy is shared and having the chance to improve are great opportunities.</p>
<p>There were 3 party halls. Salsa, Bachata and Kizomba. Air-conditioning in each hall was excellent, the floor was perfect and the music was delightful.</p>
<p>Besides workshops and nighttime events, during the festival Turkey Salsa Championship took place and it was broadcast live on NTV. Moreover, on Sunday morning there was a Zumba party. We can clearly say that the festival was for everyone who was interested in dancing in any way.</p>
<p>We would like to thank those who worked very hard to make this festival happen, and especially İbrahim Keskin, the main organizer, for creating this amazing festival which played an important role in improving dance one a national scale, enlarging the network and increasing the number of people who love dancing.</p>
<p>We hope that this festival will grow even bigger each year and we are looking forward to meeting you wherever dance takes us!</p>
