        <h1>A festival packed with enthusiasm in a city full of excitement</h1>
      
      
        <p>Eskişehir Dance Festival (EDF) took place in Tasigo Otel from 24 February until 26 February. It seems that this festival grows even bigger each year with more participants and is now among Turkey’s biggest festivals. I went to this festival for the first time, and my students and I had a great time there.</p>
<p>And its location Eskişehir was a huge plus to attract many dancers and dance enthusiasts. The distinguished Mayor of Eskişehir really turned this city into a modern attraction. It is a city which preserves its history, natural beauty and allows to create something out of nothing.</p>
<p>While we were at the festival we also went to tours. There were those who attended day-long dance workshops and some others spent their day walking around the city.</p>
<p>There were no vacancies available at the Tasigo festival hotel which is in the historic Odunpazarı region, so we stayed at the hotels near the festival. They were all historical mansion which were later turned into hotels. We stayed at three different hotels. Paşakonağı hotel, Arslanlı hotel and Abacı Konak hotel. We were all satisfied by their services.</p>
<p>As for the festival… The dancing classes with mostly Turkish trainers were a big hit. Seeing that we had such a great group of trainers and that there was a great number of participants really put a smile on our faces. And this definitely showed us the point to which dance has risen in Turkey. Since I wanted to save my energy for the dance nights, I only got to attend Antonio and Jasmina Bernardi’s two workshops; they were all spectacular. Probably they were not expecting that many participants, because it got so crowded that I had some problems with being able to see the trainer, but still no one left those halls. For the love of dance!!</p>
<p>Antonio and Jasmina’s On2 Partnerwork and Orishas workshops were amazing.</p>
<p>We mostly attended the dance night events at the festival. During the first night, due to the extremely high number of participants, the halls couldn’t hold that many people, and in one of the halls the wood flooring was broken into pieces but still people resisted leaving. They opened two more halls for the second night.</p>
<p>It is really not an easy task to pull off a festival this huge. The main organizer Aykan Gümüşcan really deserves a big thank you. This organization really took serious efforts, patience, and team work. We have already included Eskişehir in our schedule for next year.</p>
<p>To our luck, the weather was delightful and we got to tour the city.</p>
<p>Back to the dance night events, since the night events started after the shows, they started around midnight and lasted until 06.00 a.m. A weekend full of dance!</p>
<p>We really enjoyed the festival. We had great fun as a team. Of course there were somethings that were missing, but overall, when you think about this festival’s role in improving the dance community, none of those negative things matter. It is always easy to make up for the imperfections.</p>
<p>A big thank you to Aykan Gümüşcan and to those who contributed, see you next year!</p>
