    <h1>Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
  
  <main class="faqs">
    
  
    <details>
      <summary>Can everyone learn how to dance?</summary>
      <div>
        <p>Yes! Majority of the students who come to us think that they do not have the talent for dancing. But later they have all seen that everyone can do it. If you know how to walk, then you can very well dance!</p>
      </div>
    </details>
  
    <details>
      <summary>Should I bring a partner with me?</summary>
      <div>
        <p>No, you do not need a partner to learn how to dance. More than 50% of those who want to learn Latin dances come here without a partner. Having a partner is a big plus, but it is definitely not a requirement. You can easily dance at our classes by switching partners.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
  
    <details>
      <summary>How long does it take to learn how to dance?</summary>
      <div>
        <p>Long story short, it depends on the conditions. After your first lesson, you will be able to do very basic moves. Having progress beyond that is up to you and your goal. We can list out a few factors that somehow determines how long it might take you to learn how to dance:</p>
<ul>
<li>How good of a dancer you want to become</li>
<li>Which dances you want to learn</li>
<li>How frequently you take lessons</li>
<li>How often you practice what you learn</li>
<li>Your existing dancing talent</li>
</ul>
<p>And eventually, the only factor as to how much progress you can make: you. You decide what you want and how much you want it, and we are always there to help you.</p>
      </div>
    </details>
  
    <details>
      <summary>How do we learn to dance?</summary>
      <div>
        <p>Good dancers become good dancers with practice, none of them are born to be good dancers. Each move which seems flawless and effortless is the result of training and practice. I can give you three main roads to take to learn to dance.</p>
<ul>
<li>Private lessons</li>
<li>Group lessons</li>
<li>Practice lessons</li>
</ul>
<p>This way, by attending classes which are the combination of these options once or more in a week, students can learn to dance. Additionally, if it suits you, competing in a contest and working towards it can provide a great opportunity for your progress.</p>
<p>The ideal is to make use of all of the available options, but you can choose whichever is more suitable for you. You learn different things from each option:</p>
<p><strong>Private lessons:</strong></p>
<p>At first, private lessons are the ones where you learn the fundamentals, mentality and spirit of dancing. As you make progress, you will learn about how to apply subtle but elegant touches to your dancing style and how to feel better about yourself while dancing. This is the place where you create your own style. Since you dance with a professional during private lessons, you will receive immediate feedback regarding what you do right and where you need more improvement.</p>
<p>If you have ever watched two people doing the same moves and if one of them moves beautifully and smoothly while the other is not, then you know the difference private lessons can make. It is always important to keep in mind that: Dancing is not about being able to do the moves, it is about how you perform those moves. It is this &amp;#8220;how&amp;#8221; which makes you look and feel amazing.</p>
<p><strong>Group lessons:</strong></p>
<p>It is the right place to learn new moves. As I have mentioned above, dancing is not about getting the moves right, but we need them to have something to perform when music comes on!</p>
<p>The other benefit of attending group lessons is that having to switch partners helps you develop your leading and following skills between partners. It is crucial for male partners to be able to lead any female partner and for female partners to be able to keep in step with any male partner.</p>
<p>Through group lessons you can practice the moves you have already learned. Learning to dance is about teaching your muscles how to move through repetition. Repetition is the source for developing skills. In time, your &amp;#8220;muscle memory&amp;#8221; will help you dance naturally and without even you thinking about it.</p>
<p><strong>Practice lessons:</strong></p>
<p>To learn how to dance, you need to dance! Practice hours give you opportunity to repeat what you have learned and develop muscle memory. When your moves become automatic, it is then time for other factors: you start listening to the music more, can focus more on your partners and have time to create your own style.</p>
<p>Over time you will be able to distinguish between different dances and music.</p>

    <details>
      <summary>What should I wear when I come to class?</summary>
      <div>
        <p>Any daily outfit that you feel comfortable in is okay. For females, wearing a skirt can be a source of motivation. Since this is not a regular sports lesson, you should not wear sweatpants and sneakers. You can start off with a pair of shoes with soles that allow for sliding before purchasing a pair of dance shoes. It is usually preferred for women to wear mid heel shoes.</p>
