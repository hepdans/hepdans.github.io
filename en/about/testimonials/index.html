        <p>I have always been keen on dancing, especially Latin dances. I now say to myself I wish I had the courage to start earlier. Since the day I started going to ESM I felt that I belonged there. And the main reason was Hande’s amazing energy and kindness. There were times when I did not have enough motivation. And my teacher was always there when I needed her. Sometimes the way a person looks at you is enough to motivate you to succeed and act. Now, this is my 5th month here. I am much better compared to when I first started. I believe that I will be even better because I have an awesome teacher who loves what she does and does the best she can.</p>

        <p>Rashida recommended me this place and I have been here for a year now. I used to have a hard time doing synchronized sports before I started dancing, but now I am shocked at my progress as someone who never had any experience in dancing. I now feel more confident in psychomotor activities. And most importantly, I can now dance. Hande taught me the very basics in such detail that I could take small but firm steps towards success. Moreover, I got to meet a lot of amazing people including Hande. I am very thankful to be a part of this.</p>

        <p>I have been a Latin Dance student at ESM for 5 years now. I continue my dancing practices with our trainer Hande Ermiş. I would like to thank Hande who helped me take up dancing and gave me the opportunity to make amazing friends. We can have loads of fun and let off steam here. We do warm-up exercises, then cool-downs… Considering how I have been coming here for five years, I don’t think it is necessary to explain how much fun it is!</p>

        <p>As it is the case for most people, I also have ups and downs, a hectic job routine, disappointments, and moments of hopelessness in my life. As life passes by, it should be our goal to keep up with time instead of whining about it passing, and have a ton of fun doing so.<br />We all have different coping mechanisms. I am one of those who choose dancing. A few years ago I first discovered zumba thanks to Hande, and then I moved on to salsa, bachata and other styles.<br />With each dance I learned I became a different person who looked at life more positively and enjoyed living more than ever. Hande keeps our energy flowing not only with dance lessons but also by organizing social events and dance nights.<br />In addition to her being an extremely talented dance teacher, she is also great friend with never-ending energy and positivity. I am glad to have met you! Looking forward to dancing with you for years to come.</p>

        <p>I started dancing with Tango. I then decided that I wanted something more energetic and fun, so I shifted to Salsa and Bachata. I looked for numerous dancing schools before finally landing in Hep Dans thanks to a friend’s advice. After an introductory lesson I realized that Hep Dans was it for me. The way Hande teaches us (always very detailed and shows even the smallest steps) and how she always pays attention to everyone creates a welcoming environment, and I just love it. She knows how to motivate us. To spend more time at the school I joined intermediate and advances classes. And I never miss Sunday practices.</p>
        <p>Birthdays are never celebrated without a proper birthday cake! And even if there isn’t anything to celebrate, we always go out at nights. Hande always invites us all. This way she creates a very social and friendly environment for all of us to enjoy. I have met a lot of amazing people here and I have attended many events with them. Now, I always have a place to go and have fun at weekends and nights. Thus, you know many people at places you go to and they know you, too! You can never feel alone at Latin dance nights.</p>
        <p>Even if I have very busy workdays, am going through stressful times or feel down, I always attend our classes. Because as soon as you hear the music and start dancing, you forget about all the negativity. Since you focus only on what you are doing, nothing else matters anymore. I can blow off some steam while I am dancing and leave my daily business life behind. Salsa is the best way to go because it involves exciting moves and music.</p>
        <p>I am nowhere near being talented. But thanks to Hande and my personal efforts, I think I can dance a lot better now. I have made great progress in Salsa from the very basics to different combinations, to music appreciation and to styling. Salsa and Bachata have many cool tricks. As you learn them the way you dance becomes more elegant.</p>
        <p>Whoever wants to learn or try to learn how to dance today should try it at Hep Dans. It is best place to take up dancing or take up from where you once left off.</p>

        <p>Do you have something to tell? Then, dance it out loud!</p>
        <p>Just go out there and let the feelings flow through your moves! Relax! Leave the day’s stress and negativity behind! Always smile and be happy! This has been my life philosophy since the day I met you 🙂</p>
        <p>Dear Hande, they say that no encounter is a coincidence; meeting you initiated a colorful change in my life. Dancing and existing through dance… I can’t thank you enough for teaching me how to express my true nature, emotions by becoming one with music and dance, making me love Latin dances, and teaching me how dancing strengthens sincere friendships.</p>
        <p>And it doesn’t even end there! Latin dances are worldwide now, so wherever we go, we can find a small salsa night gathering after spending a few minutes on the internet; and even though we might not speak the language there, we can communicate and socialize through the international language of dance which you taught us well. I would also like to thank you for all the people I have met and the friends I have made…</p>

        <p>I've looked for a Jive instructor for a long time before finding Hep Dans and starting to take lessons from Hande Ermiş. After several months of improving my Jive skills, we have added other dances like Cha Cha Cha, American Rumba and Disco to our lessons. Beside being a lot of fun, each dance has contributed significantly to my coordination, balance, posture and mental health. Especially for someone who works out regularly, dancing and gym exercises complement one another very nicely.</p>
        <p>In addition to being an excellent teacher, Ms Ermiş motivates her students really well and genuinely cares about their improvement. I consider myself to be very fortunate to take lessons from her.</p>
